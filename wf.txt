The default value is used during deserialization to assign a value to a field or property IF the document being deserialized doesn't have a value for that field or property.

If you create an object in memory with a null value for the Title property then a null will be stored in the database. Just because Title is null doesn't mean it's going to be replaced with the default value when the document is saved.
